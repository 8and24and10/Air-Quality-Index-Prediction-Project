# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Project
This project looks into the climate and environment dataset with a primary goal of building an effective model to predict future Air Pollution Index (AQI) using previous data including precipitation, temperature and AQI in Alameda. Our team explores several impor- tant datasets published by Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA). Through this process, we perform data cleaning, EDA, and transformations to identify the relationship between the different variables. Besides that, our group implemented linear regression and random forest regression in order to see how these models perform in different situations. Experimental results showed that after hyper- parameter tuning, the multiple linear regression model performed better in the prediction of the AQI. This work also illustrates that combining machine learning with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve some related environmental problems.
